# Day 6: Trash Compactor

## Story

After helping the Elves in the kitchen, you jumped into the garbage chute and ended up in a garbage smasher. While waiting for a family of cephalopods to open the magnetically sealed door, you help the youngest with her math homework.

## Problem

The math worksheet has problems arranged vertically in columns:
- Numbers are stacked vertically
- The operator (`+` or `*`) is at the bottom
- Problems are separated by columns of only spaces

### Example

```
123 328  51 64
 45 64  387 23
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +
```

This contains four problems:
- 123 * 45 * 6 = 33210
- 328 + 64 + 98 = 490
- 51 * 387 * 215 = 4243455
- 64 + 23 + 314 = 401

**Grand Total: 33210 + 490 + 4243455 + 401 = 4277556**

## Part 1

Solve the problems on the math worksheet. What is the grand total found by adding together all of the answers to the individual problems?
